# 🧵 Go Concurrency Model: Restaurant Analogy & Internal Scheduler

This refined guide uses a vivid **restaurant analogy** to explain how Go's concurrency model works, especially its M:N scheduler — where **many goroutines (G)** are mapped to **fewer OS threads (M)** via **logical processors (P)**.

## 🍽️ Refined Analogy — Go’s Concurrency System

| Concept              | Analogy                          | Who Manages It?        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Goroutines (G)       | 🧾 Orders from customers         | Go runtime              |
| Logical Processors (P)| 👨‍🍳 Cooks handling queues       | Go runtime (`GOMAXPROCS`) |
| OS Threads (M)       | 🔥 Stove burners                | OS + Go runtime         |
| Scheduler            | 👨‍🍳👨‍🍳 Head chef coordinating cooks | Go runtime              |
| Hardware Threads (CPU)| 🧑‍🍳 Available kitchen stations   | OS / Hardware           |

## 🔄 What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. The **Go runtime (head chef)** determines how many **cooks (Ps)** to allow via `GOMAXPROCS`.
2. Each **cook (P)** handles a queue of **orders (goroutines)**.
3. A **cook (P)** needs a **stove burner (M)** to execute their work.
4. The **OS schedules the burner (M)** onto one of the **available kitchen stations (hardware threads)**.

## ❓ Common Question: Does Go Use OS Logical Processors to Decide Ps?

> "Does Go inspect the number of logical processors (hardware threads) from the OS to determine the number of Ps?"

✅ **Short Answer**: No.

- Go **does not rely** on OS logical processors to decide the number of Ps.
- You control the number of Ps using `GOMAXPROCS`.
- Go then dynamically manages the number of stove burners (Ms — OS threads) as needed.

## ✅ Final Key Clarification

| Component      | Description                                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 🧾 Goroutines (G) | Tasks or functions to be run                      |
| 👨‍🍳 Logical Processor (P) | Schedulers that manage goroutines          |
| 🔥 OS Thread (M)   | Execution threads assigned by OS                |
| 🧑‍🍳 CPU Core / Hardware Thread | Physical or logical execution unit         |

> 🔁 **Summary**: A **goroutine** runs on a **P**, which is executed on an **M**, which is then scheduled onto a **CPU core** by the OS.

---

## 🧠 Analogy Recap

Each **cook (P)** works a queue of **orders (G)** using a **burner (M)**. If the burner is blocked (e.g., I/O), the **chef (scheduler)** reassigns the cook to a new burner, ensuring continuous work.

> ✅ **Efficient. Scalable. Non-blocking.** That’s Go's concurrency superpower.
