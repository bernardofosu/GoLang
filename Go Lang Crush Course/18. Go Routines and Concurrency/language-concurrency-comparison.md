# üß† Does Any Programming Language Have Concurrency ‚ÄúBy Default‚Äù?

**Short answer:**  
‚û°Ô∏è Most programming languages do **NOT** run code concurrently by default.  
They execute code sequentially, unless you explicitly define concurrency using threads, coroutines, or asynchronous constructs.

## üí° What Does ‚ÄúBy Default‚Äù Really Mean?

If you write two functions in most languages:

```python
print("Hello")
print("World")
```

They will run one after the other ‚Äî not at the same time.

If you want them to run at the same time (concurrently), you have to ask for it using:

- threads  
- goroutines  
- async/await  
- tasks  
- or similar features

## üöÄ Let‚Äôs Compare Some Languages

| Language   | Default Execution | Concurrency Style                             | Notes                                              |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Go         | Sequential        | `go func()` starts goroutine                  | Very easy concurrency with `go` keyword            |
| Python     | Sequential        | `threading`, `asyncio`, `multiprocessing`     | `async/await` for lightweight concurrency          |
| JavaScript | Sequential        | `async/await`, `Promise`, `setTimeout()`      | Single-threaded but uses an event loop             |
| Java       | Sequential        | `Thread`, `ExecutorService`, `CompletableFuture` | Multi-threading is more verbose                |
| Rust       | Sequential        | `std::thread`, `async/.await`, `tokio`        | Concurrency is safe but requires explicit design   |
| C#         | Sequential        | `async/await`, `Task`, `Thread`               | Very strong async support                          |
| Kotlin     | Sequential        | Coroutines (`launch`, `async`)                | Built-in coroutine support                         |
| Swift      | Sequential        | `DispatchQueue`, `async/await` (since Swift 5.5) | Uses GCD or structured concurrency              |
| **C**      | Sequential        | `pthread`, platform-dependent threading APIs  | Manual thread management with low-level control    |
| **C++**    | Sequential        | `std::thread`, `std::async`, `<future>`       | Modern concurrency from C++11 onwards              |
