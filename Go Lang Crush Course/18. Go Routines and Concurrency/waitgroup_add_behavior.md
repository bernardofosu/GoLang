# ✅ Great Follow-up! Understanding `wg.Add(1)` Inside vs Outside a Loop

Let's break down the behavior of `wg.Add(1)` when it's placed **inside** a loop versus **outside** a loop.

---

## 🧠 Key Concept

```
wg.Add(1) ➕  Increments the counter by 1.
wg.Done() ➖  Decrements the counter by 1.
wg.Wait() ⏸️  Blocks until the counter becomes 0.
```

---

## 🔁 1. Using `wg.Add(1)` **Inside** a Loop

When you place `wg.Add(1)` **inside** the loop:

- The counter is incremented in each iteration.
- If the loop runs 10 times, the counter increases from 0 to 10.
- Each goroutine must call `wg.Done()` to decrement the counter.

### 🔍 What's Happening?

```
- 10x wg.Add(1) ➜ counter becomes 10
- Each goroutine runs and calls wg.Done()
- After 10x wg.Done(), counter becomes 0
- wg.Wait() unblocks
```

### ✅ Example Code:

```go
var wg sync.WaitGroup

for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    wg.Add(1)
    go func(id int) {
        defer wg.Done()
        fmt.Printf("Goroutine %d started\n", id)
        // Simulate work...
        fmt.Printf("Goroutine %d finished\n", id)
    }(i)
}

wg.Wait()
```

---

## 🔂 2. Using `wg.Add(1)` **Outside** the Loop

If you call `wg.Add(1)` only once **before** the loop or goroutines:

- Only **one** goroutine is being tracked.
- Once that goroutine finishes and calls `wg.Done()`, the counter becomes 0.
- `wg.Wait()` unblocks immediately after that one goroutine is done.

### ✅ Example Code:

```go
var wg sync.WaitGroup

wg.Add(1)

go func() {
    defer wg.Done()
    fmt.Println("Goroutine started")
    // Simulate work...
    fmt.Println("Goroutine finished")
}()

wg.Wait()
```

### 🔍 What's Happening?

```
- wg.Add(1) ➜ counter = 1
- One goroutine runs and calls wg.Done() ➜ counter = 0
- wg.Wait() unblocks
```

## 🔬 Comparing the Two Scenarios

| Scenario               | Add Calls | Done Calls | Counter at Start | Counter at End | wg.Wait() Unblocks When |
|------------------------|-----------|------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Inside the Loop        | 10        | 10         | 0 ➜ 10           | 10 ➜ 0         | After all goroutines    |
| Outside the Loop       | 1         | 1          | 0 ➜ 1            | 1 ➜ 0          | After one goroutine     |

---

## 🧮 Visualizing the Difference

### Case 1: `wg.Add(1)` Inside the Loop

```text
Initial counter: 0

Repeat 10 times:
wg.Add(1) ➜ counter += 1 (up to 10)
goroutine starts ➜ calls wg.Done() ➜ counter -= 1

After all 10:
counter = 0 ➜ wg.Wait() unblocks
```

### Case 2: `wg.Add(1)` Outside the Loop

```text
Initial counter: 0
wg.Add(1) ➜ counter = 1
1 goroutine starts ➜ calls wg.Done() ➜ counter = 0
wg.Wait() unblocks
```

## 🧠 Conceptual Diagram for `wg.Add(1)` Inside a 10-Iteration Loop

```text
WaitGroup Counter: 0
      |
wg.Add(1) --> Counter: 1  ──┬── Goroutine A
                            |
                          wg.Done() -> Counter: 0
                                   |
                             wg.Wait() unblocks

   (Repeat 9 more times)
   
After 10 iterations:

wg.Add(1) --> Counter: 10  ──┬── Goroutine A
                             ├── Goroutine B
                             ├── Goroutine C
                             ├── Goroutine D
                             ├── Goroutine E
                             ├── Goroutine F
                             ├── Goroutine G
                             ├── Goroutine H
                             ├── Goroutine I
                             └── Goroutine J
                                   |
                          Each calls wg.Done() (↓ counter)
                                   |
           wg.Done()  -> Counter: 9
           wg.Done()  -> Counter: 8
           wg.Done()  -> Counter: 7
           wg.Done()  -> Counter: 6
           wg.Done()  -> Counter: 5
           wg.Done()  -> Counter: 4
           wg.Done()  -> Counter: 3
           wg.Done()  -> Counter: 2
           wg.Done()  -> Counter: 1
           wg.Done()  -> Counter: 0
                                   |
                                wg.Wait() unblocks
```

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

- ✅ **Inside the loop**: You track multiple goroutines. `wg.Add(1)` is called 10 times, and `wg.Wait()` unblocks after all 10 `wg.Done()` calls.
- ✅ **Outside the loop**: You track only one goroutine. `wg.Add(1)` is called once, and `wg.Wait()` unblocks as soon as one `wg.Done()` is called.

Use `wg.Add(1)` inside the loop when you want to track and wait for multiple concurrent goroutines.

### Calling wg.Add(2) inside each iteration
means you're increasing the WaitGroup counter by 2 per iteration. So if your loop runs 10 times, the counter will go from 0 → 20 (because 10 × 2 = 20).

However, you must make sure that for every wg.Add(2), you have two matching wg.Done() calls — otherwise, wg.Wait() will never unblock, and your program will hang.

🔁 Example:
```go
var wg sync.WaitGroup

for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    wg.Add(2)  // Add 2 for two goroutines

    go func(id int) {
        defer wg.Done()
        fmt.Printf("First goroutine %d\n", id)
    }(i)

    go func(id int) {
        defer wg.Done()
        fmt.Printf("Second goroutine %d\n", id)
    }(i)
}
```

wg.Wait() // Waits for 20 Done() calls
🔍 What's happening?
wg.Add(2) is called 10 times → counter = 20

Each of the 20 goroutines calls wg.Done() once → counter decrements to 0

wg.Wait() unblocks when the counter reaches 0

If you forget one of the wg.Done() calls, the counter will never hit zero, and the program will block indefinitely at wg.Wait().
