| âœ… Structs                              | 15â€“20%           | Super important for working with real-world data |
| âœ… Conditionals, Loops                  | 10%              | if, for, switch, etc.                        |

| âœ… Interfaces (Goâ€™s version of OOP)    | 15â€“20%           | Allows polymorphism                           |
| âœ… Goroutines & Channels (Concurrency)  | 20â€“25%           | Go's strongest feature â€” lightweight concurrency |

## ðŸ’¡ TL;DR:
- Learning structs = ðŸ“ˆ major progress (you're now building custom data!)
- But thereâ€™s more ahead: slices, maps, interfaces, and goroutines are also key ðŸ”‘
- Think of structs like the doorway to building full programs â€” you're no longer stuck with just numbers and strings!
