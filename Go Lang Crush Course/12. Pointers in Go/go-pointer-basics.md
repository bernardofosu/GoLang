# 🧠 In Go, * and & Mean Different Things:

| Symbol | Meaning                     | Example              |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| &      | Address of (create pointer) | `&x` → pointer to x  |
| *      | Dereference (get value)     | `*ptr` → value at pointer |

## 🛠 Let's break your example down step-by-step:

```go
func modify(val *int) {
    *val = 100
}
```

- `val *int`  
  👉 This means the function is receiving a pointer to an integer (not a regular int).

- `*val = 100`  
  👉 This means: “Go to the memory address stored in val, and set that value to 100.”  
  It’s called **dereferencing** — getting the value that the pointer points to.

---

## 🔁 How it works in main():

```go
x := 10        // a normal int
modify(&x)     // pass a pointer to x using &
```

- `&x` gets the memory address of `x` and sends it to `modify()`.

- Inside `modify()`, `*val = 100` sets the value at that memory address to 100.

- So the change reflects back in `main()` because you're modifying the original variable.

---

## 📦 Visual Example:

```go
x := 10        // x → 10
ptr := &x      // ptr → points to x
*ptr = 20      // changes x to 20
```

---

## ✅ Recap:

- `*T` in a function parameter (like `*int`) means “I want a pointer to T.”
- `&x` gives you the address of `x`
- `*x` gives you the value at that address (dereferencing)

## ❌ A common mistake:

You said:

```go
func modify(val int) {
    val = 100
}

func main() {
    x := 10
    modify(&x)
    fmt.Println(x) // Output: 100 — now it's changed
}
```

ChatGPT said:

You're absolutely right to question that — and no, this will NOT work in Go.

### ❌ Here's your code:

```go
func modify(val int) {
    val = 100
}

func main() {
    x := 10
    modify(&x) // ❌ This will cause a compile-time error
    fmt.Println(x)
}
```

---

## 🧨 What’s the problem?

You're trying to pass a pointer (`&x`) to a function that expects a regular int (`val int`) — Go is strict about types, so this mismatch will give you a compile-time error:

```
cannot use &x (type *int) as type int in argument to modify
```

---

## ✅ How to Fix It

### Option 1: Pass just the value (no `&`) if you don’t need to modify the original:

```go
func modify(val int) {
    val = 100
}

func main() {
    x := 10
    modify(x) // ✅ OK
    fmt.Println(x) // Output: 10 — no change!
}
```

### Option 2: Use a pointer to modify the original:

```go
func modify(val *int) {
    *val = 100
}

func main() {
    x := 10
    modify(&x) // ✅ OK
    fmt.Println(x) // Output: 100 — modified!
}
```

## 🔁 Summary

| Code                         | Result                   |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| `modify(x)` with `val int`  | ✅ Works, but no changes made |
| `modify(&x)` with `val int` | ❌ Compile error          |
| `modify(&x)` with `val *int`| ✅ Works and modifies `x` |

---

## ✅ Final Tip

If you pass just the value to a function, it gets a copy of the value — not the original.

```go
func modify(val int) {
    val = 100
}

func main() {
    x := 10
    modify(x)      // ❌ Doesn't change x
    fmt.Println(x) // ➡️ Output: 10
}
```

But if you want to actually change `x`, pass a pointer:

```go
func modify(val *int) {
    *val = 100
}

func main() {
    x := 10
    modify(&x)      // ✅ Sends the memory address of x
    fmt.Println(x)  // ➡️ Output: 100
}
```

---

## 🧠 Think of it like this:

| What you pass | What happens inside the function     |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `x`           | A copy is made. Original is untouched. |
| `&x`          | A reference is passed. Original is changed. |
