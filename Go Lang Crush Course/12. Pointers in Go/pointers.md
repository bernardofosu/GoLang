ðŸ“‚ Mounting C: Drive in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
When you mount your Windows C: drive into WSL (like /mnt/c/):

You are not copying C drive into Linux.

You are not moving the files into Linux either.

You are simply creating a pointer (shortcut) to C drive.

When you change files inside /mnt/c/Users/..., you are directly modifying the original files in Windows C: drive.

âœ… So: No copy, no move, just pointer.

ðŸ”¥ Same idea with Pointers in Go:
When you use:

go
Copy
Edit
func handler(c *gin.Context)
You are not copying the Context struct (which can be huge).

You are not creating a new Context.

You are simply pointing to the original Context for that HTTP request.

Any change you make to c inside the function will affect the real request/response.

âœ… Again: No copy, no move, just pointer.

ðŸ§  Memory/Storage Visual:

Example	Explanation
WSL Mount	/mnt/c/ â†’ Just pointing to Windows C: drive
Pointer *gin.Context	Just pointing to real Context in memory
ðŸ”µ Mount/Pointer = lightweight shortcut â†’ Access and modify real resource.

ðŸ“¢ Final words:
âœ… Pointer in Go = Mounting C drive in WSL.
âœ… Both mean "access and modify the real thing, without copying."
