# Go Packages Overview

Go‚Äôs power really shines through its standard library and community packages. Let‚Äôs break down the most used Go packages ‚Äî both from the standard library and popular external ones ‚Äî along with real-world use cases.

## üß† Summary
- Start with standard packages like `fmt`, `net/http`, `os`, and `time`.
- Then explore external packages when you need something specialized.
- Many Go projects are web servers, CLIs, and microservices ‚Äî the package ecosystem supports that perfectly.
