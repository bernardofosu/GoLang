## 📁 File Handling in Go — Explained Step-by-Step

Go’s `os` and `io` packages make it simple to handle files. Here's how to perform basic file operations with explanations. 👇

---

### 1️⃣ 📄 Create and Write to a File
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// 🔧 Create a file named "example.txt"
	file, err := os.Create("example.txt")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer file.Close() // 📌 Ensure file is closed after writing

	// ✍️ Write text into the file
	file.WriteString("Hello, Go File Handling! 🚀")

	fmt.Println("✅ File created and text written!")
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `os.Create()` → Creates or overwrites a file.
- `defer file.Close()` → Ensures file is properly closed.
- `file.WriteString()` → Writes text to the file.
- `panic()` immediately stops the normal execution of the program.
- `defer` — "Do This When You're Done"

#### 😱 panic — "Something Went Very Wrong!"
- panic() immediately stops the normal execution of the program.
- It’s usually used when something unrecoverable happens (like a missing file or a database crash).

#### 🧹 defer — "Do This When You're Done"
- defer delays the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns (ends).
- It’s commonly used to close files, unlock resources, or clean up.

### 2️⃣ 📖 Read from a File
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// 📖 Read the entire file content
	data, err := os.ReadFile("example.txt")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// 🖨️ Print the content
	fmt.Println("📖 File content:")
	fmt.Println(string(data))
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `os.ReadFile()` → Reads all content into memory.
- `string(data)` → Converts byte slice into a readable string.

---

### 3️⃣ ➕ Append Text to an Existing File
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// 📂 Open file in append mode
	file, err := os.OpenFile("example.txt", os.O_APPEND|os.O_WRONLY, 0644)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer file.Close()

	// 🖊️ Add a new line to the file
	file.WriteString("\nAdded new line! ✨")

	fmt.Println("✅ Text appended to file!")
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `os.OpenFile()` → Opens file in append + write-only mode.
  - `os.O_APPEND` → Data is added at the end.
  - `os.O_WRONLY` → Write access only.
- `0644` → Unix permissions (owner: read/write, others: read).

---

### 4️⃣ 🗑️ Delete a File
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// ❌ Delete the file
	err := os.Remove("example.txt")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("🗑️ File deleted!")
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `os.Remove()` → Deletes the file from the filesystem.

---

### 🔐 File Permissions (Unix systems)
- `0644` → Owner can read/write, others can read.
- `0755` → Owner can read/write/execute, others can read/execute.

---

### 📦 Packages Used
- `os` → For file creation, deletion, opening.
- `fmt` → For printing output.
- `bufio`, `io` → Useful for more advanced I/O.

---

### 🧠 TL;DR
Task | Function | Use for…
---- | -------- | ---------
Create | `os.Create()` | Making a new file
Write | `file.WriteString()` | Adding content
Read | `os.ReadFile()` | Loading entire file into memory
Append | `os.OpenFile()` + `O_APPEND` | Add more content without deletion
Delete | `os.Remove()` | Remove the file entirely

✅ Always use `defer file.Close()` to avoid resource leaks!
