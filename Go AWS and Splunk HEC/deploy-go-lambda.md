save .md file Exactly! You compile your Go Lambda function locally first, including all dependencies like the AWS SDK, into a single binary. Then you upload that compiled binary to AWS Lambda.
How it works step-by-step:

    Write your Go Lambda code, importing the AWS SDK and other libraries you need.

    Initialize your Go module (if you haven't yet):

go mod init your-module-name

Add dependencies and build your binary:

go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o main main.go

    GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 ensures you build for the Linux environment Lambda uses.

Zip your binary (Lambda expects a zip):

    zip function.zip main

    Upload the zip file to AWS Lambda via console, CLI, or Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation).

    Configure Lambda handler to use the binary (usually main or your chosen name).

    When Lambda runs your function, it executes the compiled binary directly, no need to install packages or modules.

If you want, I can provide a simple example repo structure or build script!

Here are step-by-step instructions to upload your Go Lambda function zip file to AWS Lambda using both Console and AWS CLI:
✅ 1. Using AWS Console
Step-by-step:

    Log in to the AWS Management Console.

    Navigate to Lambda service.

    Click “Create function” (or open an existing one).

    Choose:

        Author from scratch

        Runtime: Go 1.x

        Name: YourFunctionName

        Architecture: x86_64

    Click Create function.

    Scroll down to the “Function code” section.

    Under Code entry type, select: Upload a .zip file.

    Click Upload, and choose the function.zip you created:

zip function.zip main

Set the Handler to:

    main

    Click Save.

    Now your function is ready! Click Test to run it manually or configure a trigger (like S3 or API Gateway).

✅ 2. Using AWS CLI
Prerequisites:

    AWS CLI installed & configured (aws configure)

    IAM Role with Lambda permissions ready

    Your function compiled and zipped: function.zip

Step-by-step:
✅ a. Create a new Lambda function

aws lambda create-function \
  --function-name my-golang-lambda \
  --runtime go1.x \
  --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/lambda-execution-role \
  --handler main \
  --zip-file fileb://function.zip \
  --timeout 15 \
  --memory-size 128 \
  --region us-east-1

    Replace arn:aws:iam::... with your actual Lambda execution role ARN.

✅ b. Update an existing Lambda function

aws lambda update-function-code \
  --function-name my-golang-lambda \
  --zip-file fileb://function.zip \
  --region us-east-1

✅ Verify your deployment

aws lambda get-function --function-name my-golang-lambda

You can then test your Lambda from the console or by invoking it:

aws lambda invoke --function-name my-golang-lambda output.json
