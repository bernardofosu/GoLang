# 🌿 How to Build Your Go Gin App

## 📁 1. Save Your Code in a File
Example project structure:
```bash
your_project/
├── main.go
├── templates/
│   └── hello.html
```

**`main.go`** - your main Go source file.

**`templates/hello.html`** - example template:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Welcome</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, {{ .name }}!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

---

## 👉 2. Open Terminal Inside Your Project Folder
```bash
cd your_project
```

---

## 🛠️ 3. Initialize a Go Module (only once)
If you haven't yet:
```bash
go mod init your_project
```
✅ This will create a `go.mod` file to manage dependencies.

---

## 🎯 4. Download the Gin Package
If you don't have it yet:
```bash
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
```
✅ This downloads and sets up Gin inside your project automatically.

---

## 💪 5. Build Your App
Run:
```bash
go build -o myapp
go build -o myapp.exe main.go # windows
```
Explanation:
- `go build` → Compiles your `main.go`
- `-o myapp` → Outputs a binary named `myapp`

Resulting structure:
```bash
your_project/
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── main.go
├── myapp         # <-- compiled executable!
├── templates/
│   └── hello.html
```

---

## 💡 6. Run Your App
Start your server:
```bash
./myapp
```
(Windows users run: `myapp.exe`)

✅ Your server will start on: `http://localhost:8080`

---

## 📣 Bonus Tip: Quick Run
While developing, instead of building every time:
```bash
go run main.go
```
This builds and runs in **one step** without creating a binary.

## 🎉 Final Recap
| Command | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `go mod init your_project` | Create module |
| `go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin` | Download Gin framework |
| `go build -o myapp` | Build executable `myapp` |
| `./myapp` | Run compiled app |
| `go run main.go` | Quick run without building |

---

# 🚀 Production Tip: Tiny Binary!
Want a smaller production binary?
Use:
```bash
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o myapp
```
- `-s -w` removes debug info
- Results in a much smaller executable!

---

# 📢 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|:---|:---|
| No `myapp.exe` after build? | Run `go build -o myapp.exe main.go` again |
| Cannot run `myapp.exe`? | Use `./myapp.exe` (current directory notation) |
| Still errors? | Ensure you are inside the correct project folder |

# 🌈 Mind Map:
```
Write Code -> Build -> Get Executable -> Run
```
(Go is standalone! Unlike Python.)
